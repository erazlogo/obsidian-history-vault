This is a starter vault for historical research with Zotero and Obsidian. To download, click on the "Code" button on the github page.

For directions on how to use this vault, go to [Doing History with Zotero and Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/history-notes/).

This vault will be updated frequently during the summer of 2022. To migrate to the new version, just move your notes into matching folders into the new vault. Check changelog to find out what else needs to be updated.

## Some features available in this vault:

Extract an annotation as a "research note" from your imported annotations file (i.e. from your literature note, in Obsidian-speak) with all source information included, with a link placed in your original annotations file. Includes a prompt for setting a note title:

Search and sort your research notes (atomic literature notes) by field dynamically. Will work for regular literature notes as well:
