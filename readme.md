This is a starter vault for historical research with Zotero and Obsidian. To download, click on the "Code" button on the Github page.

For directions on how to use this vault, go to [Doing History with Zotero and Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/history-notes/).

This vault will be updated frequently during the summer of 2022. To migrate to a newer version, just move your notes into matching folders in the new vault. 

## Some features available in this vault:

Import your annotations from Zotero with [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration). The imported "literature note" includes Zotero item metadata and a predefined template for working with notes:

Extract an annotation as an atomic "research note" from your literature note (imported annotations file), using [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater). The new note will include all source information and the template for working with notes. The script includes a prompt for setting new note title and places a link to the new note in your original annotations file.

Search and sort your research notes (atomic literature notes) by fields dynamically, with [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). This search works for regular literature notes as well.
