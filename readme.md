This is a starter vault for historical research with Zotero and Obsidian. To download, click on the "Code" button on the Github page.

For directions on how to use this vault, go to [Doing History with Zotero and Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/history-notes/).

This vault will be updated frequently during the summer of 2022. To migrate to a newer version, just move your notes into matching folders in the new vault. 

## Advanced Features and Best Practices for Historians
- Combine free-form "Zettelkasten" linking of ideas with structured data necessary to know who did what and when.
- [Import your PDF annotations](https://github.com/erazlogo/obsidian-history-vault#import-your-annotations-from-zotero) from Zotero into Obsidian, including archive, archive-location, and recipient fields. This makes possible archival research (including private correspondence), central for historical work.
- [Split the resulting "literature note" into atomic "research notes"](https://github.com/erazlogo/obsidian-history-vault#extract-an-annotation-as-an-atomic-research-note) that will be later sorted into groups for writing. Different annotations from the same source might belong in different places in your draft.
- [Search and sort research notes by source metadata](https://github.com/erazlogo/obsidian-history-vault#search-and-sort-your-notes-by-source-fields), and by date of event described in the note, in a familiar interface structured like a library catalog search.
- Trace social networks: create and link person, place, and event notes and visualize with the Graph view
- Use the Kanban plugin as a Corkboard for brainstorming your storyline, and Longform for writing, in a Scrivener-like setup 

## Showcase of features available in this vault

### Import your annotations from Zotero 

Import annotations with [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration). The imported "literature note" includes Zotero item metadata, Zotero tags, and a predefined template for working with notes.

### Extract an annotation as an atomic "research note" 

Extract an annotation from your imported annotations file (literature note) with [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater). The new note will include all source information and the template for working with notes. The script includes a prompt for setting new note title and places a link to the new note in your original annotations file.

### Search and sort your notes by source fields 

Sort your research notes and literature notes by fields dynamically, with [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). For text fields, this is a case-sensitive phrase search. Enter dates as YYYY-MM-DD. Enter tag as `#tag`. Enter exact field title and asc/desc to change sort order. The default sort in my case is by start-date, ascending, but you can search by any field included in the table.
