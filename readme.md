## Some features available in this vault

### Import your annotations from Zotero 

Import annotations with [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration). The imported "literature note" includes Zotero item metadata, Zotero tags, and a predefined template for working with notes.

### Extract an annotation as an atomic "research note" 

Extract an annotation from your imported annotations file (literature note) with [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater). The new note will include all source information and the template for working with notes. The script includes a prompt for setting new note title and places a link to the new note in your original annotations file.
