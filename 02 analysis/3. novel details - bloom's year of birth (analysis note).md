Although Ulysses is full of detail, Joyce is vague about [[5. Bloom, Leopold (person note)|Leopold Bloom's]] date of birth. Joyce includes a [[1. joyce discusses bloom's year of birth (primary note)|paragraph]] on Bloom's year of birth that tests the reader's attention to detail.

%%You can also create "transclusions"--embed [blocks of text](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks) from other notes.
 Click on the framed block below to see the code used to embed a paragraph from another note. More precisely, you type `![[` to bring up a list of notes for embedding, drill down to just one matching note by typing more words, then type `^` to choose a particular paragraph. To go to the chosen paragraph, click on the chain icon.%%

As Luca Crispi points out,
