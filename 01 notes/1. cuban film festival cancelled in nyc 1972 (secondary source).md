The same day of the momentous gala evening presided over by Chairman Mao acting as host to the U.S. president and his wife, the U.S. State Department denied visas to the, by then internationally acclaimed, Cuban directors who were to participate in the First Cuban Film Festival in New York. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright questioned why the "U.S. government should consider four filmmakers a security threat and not Mao Tse-tung and the People's Republic of China" (Myerson 1973, 30). Other senators also protested, including Edward Kennedy and George McGovern.The New YorkPost and the Los Angeles Times also questioned this act. The festival's organizer, Michael Myerson, was a leader of the New Left since its inception. A Berkeley student, Myerson organized SLATE, a radical leftist political party within the university, and went on to construct an ongoing link with the Cuban revolution. He argued that the U.S. government's treatment of the Cuban directors was unlawful, and that the eventual halt of the film festival was linked to a group of Cuban exiles, all of whom had participated in the CIA-organized Bay of Pigs invasion and were "serving" the Nixon administration (1-3). Myerson's strong evidence was the presence of other anti-Castro associations in the Nixon administration: four of the five men arrested on June 17, 1972, at the Watergate Hotel were Cuban Americans who had been linked to the CIA and to the Bay of Pigs affair.

Besides their potential relation to Nixon's government, conservative Cuban Americans played another important role in making the First Cuban Film Festival a politically laden event. 

Similar to the violence directed toward Gelber's play in 1968, radical Cuban Americans organized protests in front of the Olympia theater (which was to host the event), stoned the theater, and threatened to bomb it (32). Though the festival opened March 24, 1972, the pressures to impede its continuation were too great, and the U.S. State and Treasury Departments stopped the festival March 25, seized the prize-winning film Days of Water (1971), and committed an old-fashioned act of cultural repression. 

The critics protested. Vincent Canby of the New York Times and Jay Cocks of Time wrote to complain about the government's halting of the festival, and, as I mentioned, a group of film critics published a letter "To the Editors" in The New York Review of Books, also protesting. This letter poignantly stated: 

"We think it either sinister or absurd when access to foreign art can be turned off and on like a tap to suit the government's current policy, when Americans are not allowed to see Cuban films only weeks after the President has been televised worldwide cheerfully applauding the Peking Ballet.... The blockade of Cuba by the United States has been a foolish and destructive mistake"  ^4c67a2

The signers were Amos Vogel, Sarris, Annette Michelson, Dwight MacDonald, Gelber, Cocks,Jonas Mekas, Nat Hentoff, Richard Gilman, Ricki Franklin, Kauffmann, Stephen Koch, and William Wolf. Several of the signers would be reviewers of Cuban films.
