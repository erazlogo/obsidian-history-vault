%%^ These are fields that you can use to analyze your data.
 Words connected by a dash `-` and followed by a double column `::` are your field names. Anything on the same line to the left of `::` is the data in your field. You can use links to other notes as field data.
 You should enter the date in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, which allows you to include the time and the time zone, if necessary. At minimum, you should include yyyy-mm-dd for proper sorting.
 Leopold returned "long after midnight" but since we don't know what time exactly, 12:01 AM will do.
 If you don't need an end date for the event, just leave it blank.%%
