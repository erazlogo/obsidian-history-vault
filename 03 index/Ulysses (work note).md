%%Start-date is the publication date or the date for first installment of a serialized work
 End-date is the date of the last installment of a serialized work.
 Here I am giving the dates for the serialization of _Ulysses_ in the American journal _The Little Review_, from March 1918-December 1920. I include the day as "01" for proper sorting. Another option is to enter the year of the book's first edition: 1922-01-01 as a start date and no end-date.%% 

### Events
%%Here you can link _Ulysses_ to an event note for its controversial launch, or for its obscenity trial.%%
